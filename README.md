# ShopMate-DatingApp

## Overview

ShopMate reimagines online dating through the familiar, intuitive experience of online shopping. Browse, filter, and "add to cart" potential matches with the same ease and clarity you'd use when shopping for your favorite products.

## Concept

Traditional dating apps can feel overwhelming and imprecise. ShopMate brings the streamlined, filter-driven experience of e-commerce to dating. Just as you'd shop for the perfect item by selecting size, color, style, and price range, ShopMate lets you find compatible matches using detailed filters and preferences—shopping for your perfect mate.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Filtering System**: Sort potential matches by interests, location, lifestyle preferences, education, career goals, relationship type, and more
- **Shopping Cart**: Save interesting profiles to your cart to review later before making a decision
- **Wishlist Function**: Keep track of profiles you're interested in but not ready to message yet
- **Comparison View**: Compare multiple profiles side-by-side to see compatibility at a glance
- **Browse & Search Modes**: Toggle between casual browsing and targeted searching with specific criteria
- **Quick View**: Preview profiles without fully opening them, like product quick-view features
- **Saved Searches**: Save your favorite filter combinations for easy repeat browsing
- **Recently Viewed**: Keep track of profiles you've checked out

## How It Works

1. **Set Your Preferences**: Define what you're looking for using our comprehensive filter system

3. **Add to Cart**: Save interesting profiles to review and consider at your own pace

## The ShopMate Experience

**Note**: While ShopMate uses shopping metaphors for UX clarity and ease of use, we recognize that dating involves real people with feelings and complexity. The interface is designed to make the search process efficient and stress-free while encouraging genuine, meaningful connections.
